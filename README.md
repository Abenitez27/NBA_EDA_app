# NBA_EDA_app

Here is the link to the interactive app on [Heroku](https://nba-eda-app-streamlit.herokuapp.com/) and streamlit platform.
This application webscrapes data from the website [Basket Ball Reference] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and puts the data into a pandas data frame. Streamlit allows for the interactive user input selection boxes to change the data according to the users needs.
